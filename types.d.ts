/* 
You're using Mongoose in your Next.js app to connect to MongoDB.

To reuse the same DB connection between API routes (and avoid reconnecting every time), developers often attach the connection to global.

But TypeScript doesnâ€™t know that youâ€™ve added mongoose to the global object, so it complains. ðŸ˜¬

So, you create this types.d.ts file to tell TypeScript:

"Hey, there's a new thing on the global object called mongoose, and hereâ€™s what it looks like."
